# Belly-Button-Challenge

Background
In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels in JSON format.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Demographics information is dynamically populated based upon a user-selected test subject ID. A bar chart, bubble chart and a bonus gauge chart also update once the ID is changed. Code has been written using Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

All CSS, JS and images required are under the static folder. The main HTML file index.html is in the root folder of the Github repo.
